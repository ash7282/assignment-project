 1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

first value is True 
second values is False

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
answer :- AND, OR and NOT are the three types of boolean operators

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator&#39;s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

a = 1
b = 2
c = 4
if a > b or b < c:
    print(True)  
Output: True

if a or b or c:
    print("At least one number has boolean value as True")

a = 1
b = 2
c = 4
if a > b and b < c:
    print(True)  
Output: False


5. What are the six comparison operators?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
output: False
not (5 > 4)
output: False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
output: True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
output: False
(True and True) and (True == False)
output: False
(not False) or (not True)
output: True


6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
= assigns a value.
== checks if two values are equal.

a = 5
b = 5
if a == b:
    print("a is equal to b")
else:
    print("a and b are not equal")

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:  --- first block
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:   --- second block
        print('bacon')
else:               ----  third block
    print('ham')
    print('spam')
    print('spam')

in this there are three blocks which is if if and else are


8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

spam=[1,2,3,7,9,9,2,9,9] --- outputs is hello, Howdy
# spam=[37293,23902] --- output is greeting 
if 1 in spam:
    print("hello")
    if 2 in spam:
        print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greeting')




9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?

1 = Press Ctrl + C in the terminal or command prompt
2 = try Ctrl + Break.


10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

if we print something and you want print start from to end then stop so write break to stop same but vice versa use continue in the condition


11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
in range(10) is print value till 0 to 9 range are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
range(0,10) is print value till 0 to 9    range are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
range(0,10,1) is print value till 0 to 9     range are:  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

for i in range(0,10):
    i=i+1
    print(i)

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?

import spam
spam.bacon()
