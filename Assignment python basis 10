1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?

The main difference between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree() is that shutil.copy() copies a single file, while shutil.copytree() copies an entire directory and everything contained in it.

2. What function is used to rename files??
the function of rename file is that we can change the file name to another file name without lossing any data of original files 

3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?

The main difference between the send2trash and shutil modules is that send2trash functions move files or folders to the recycle bin, while shutil functions permanently delete files and folders

4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is
equivalent to File objects’ open() method?

The ZipFile method equivalent to File objects’ open() method is the open() method of ZipFile objects.
This method returns a file-like object (ZipExtFile) that can be used to read the contents of a specific file in the ZIP archive. 
The open() method takes a filename or a ZipInfo object as an argument and returns a file-like object that provides the following
methods: read(), readline(), readlines(), iter(), next(). This file-like object can be used independently of the ZipFile object,
but if the ZipFile object was created by passing in a file-like object as the first argument to the constructor, then the object returned by open() shares the ZipFile’s file pointer.
In this case, the object returned by open() should not be used after any additional operations are performed on the ZipFile object.
If the ZipFile object was created by passing in a string (the filename) as the first argument to the constructor, then open() will create a new file object that will be held by the ZipExtFile,
allowing it to operate independently of the ZipFile. The open() method can also take a password as an argument to decrypt encrypted files in the ZIP archive.

5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf
or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.

import os
import shutil

def find_and_copy(source_dir, target_dir, extension):
  """
  Searches the source directory and its subdirectories for files with the specified extension
  and copies them to the target directory.

  Args:
      source_dir: The directory to search for files.
      target_dir: The directory to copy the found files to.
      extension: The file extension to search for (e.g., ".pdf" or ".jpg").
  """
  for root, dirs, files in os.walk(source_dir):
    for file in files:
      if file.endswith(extension):
        source_path = os.path.join(root, file)
        target_path = os.path.join(target_dir, file)
        shutil.copy2(source_path, target_path)
        print(f"Copied {source_path} to {target_path}")

# Example usage
source_dir = "/path/to/source/folder"
target_dir = "/path/to/target/folder"
extension = ".pdf"

find_and_copy(source_dir, target_dir, extension)
